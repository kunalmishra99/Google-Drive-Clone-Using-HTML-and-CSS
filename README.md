# Google-Drive-Clone-Using-HTML-CSS
First is always special! For the first time I made a clone of an application named Google Drive, brushed up my HTML &amp; CSS basics, and learned about Material CSS. This Google Drive clone is made based on Front-End portion (HTML &amp; Material CSS) only; no Back-End is used here.
